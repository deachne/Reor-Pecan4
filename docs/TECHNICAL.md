## Document Processing System

### Overview
The document processing system is designed to handle multiple types of content (text, images, video, audio, tables) with a flexible and extensible architecture. It uses AI models for content analysis, metadata extraction, and relationship mapping.

### Components

#### Document Processor
- Implements multi-modal content processing
- Handles semantic chunking and relationship mapping
- Extracts metadata and builds document graphs
- Applies customizable workflows

#### Model Manager
- Manages AI models for different content types
- Supports both local and remote models
- Handles model loading and configuration
- Provides fallback options

#### Workflow Engine
- Executes customizable processing workflows
- Supports content transformation and categorization
- Handles document formatting and organization
- Manages processing rules and templates

### Content Types
- Text: Markdown documents, notes, reports
- Images: Photos, diagrams, screenshots
- Video: Recordings, tutorials
- Audio: Voice notes, recordings
- Tables: Structured data, spreadsheets

## Vector Database System
